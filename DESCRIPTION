Description: Provides functions for the Bayesian analysis of extreme
        value models, using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Allows
		the construction of both uninformative and informed prior 
		distributions for common statistical models applied to extreme
        event data, including the generalized extreme value distribution.
